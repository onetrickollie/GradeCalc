# Exam 1

## Rules of Behavior
1. Your submission **must** be solely you own work without the assistance of anyone by any means.
1. All programming code **must** be written in Python.
1. You **must** use Tuffix to unit test your program.
1. All your code **must** be pushed to Github by **11:59 p.m. today**.  Any submissions after that time will not be considered.
1. You may use your book and powerpoint slides.
1. You may use the Internet as a **reference only**.

## Getting Started
1. Open the Terminal program in Tuffix.
1. Change the present working directory to the `Documents` directory by typing the following command at the command prompt:

    ```
    cd Documents
    ```

1. Make a copy of this Github repository on your computer using the `git` and `clone` commands that you will input to the terminal. The commands take a URL as a parameter to specify where it can get a copy of the repository. You can find the URL by clicking on the green *Clone or download* button at the top right part of this page. Copy the URL and replace the example text shown below. Note that `username` should be replaced with your own Github username. When you hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> it will ask you to provide your Github username and token. Once done, you will have a copy of the repository on your computer.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aadi1720/Exam01-username.git
    ```
1. Navigate into the new directory using the command line. Note that `username` should be replaced with your own Github username.  As a shortcut, you can type the first few letters of the folder name and press <kbd>Tab</kbd> so that it auto completes the folder name for you.

     ```
     cd exam01-username
     ```
     
## Program Instructions
1. Your are given a main.py file which defines a dictionary of grades.  The data structure of the grades is as follows:
     ```
	grades dictionary:
		key: student id as an integer
		value : student dictionary

	student dictionary:
		for key: 'name'
		value : student name as a string

		for key: 'homework'
		value : list of homework grades for each assignment as an integer

		for key: 'laboratory'
		value : list of laboratory grades for each assignment as an integer
     ```
	The exact data used in the main.py file is as follows:
     ```
	{ 70314: { 'name': 'Anna Kendrick', 
		        'homework': [77, 83, 100], 
		        'laboratory': [85, 78] }, 

	  90919: { 'name': 'Rebel Wilson', 
		       'homework': [51, 60, 96], 
		       'laboratory': [92, 87] }, 

	  72457: { 'name': 'Brittany Snow', 
		       'homework': [97, 81, 73], 
		       'laboratory': [67, 100] }, 

	  55331: { 'name': 'Hailee Steinfeld', 	
		       'homework': [63, 67, 62], 
		       'laboratory': [100, 98] }, 

	  52392: { 'name': 'Hana Mae Lee', 
		       'homework': [95, 100, 73], 
		       'laboratory': [97, 74] }, 

	  65087: { 'name': 'Skylar Astin', 
		       'homework': [61, 89, 87], 
		       'laboratory': [100, 97] }, 

	  91523: { 'name': 'Adam DeVine', 
		       'homework': [99, 94, 89], 
		       'laboratory': [69, 91] }
	}
     ```
	While this data is given in the main.py file, your package should accept any data that meets the above dictionary data structure.  The main.py file also prints a report of a classroom grade book. The report not only contains all the grades from the grade book, it also contains several calculations to show averages and weighted averages.  Your package will calculate all the averages needed for the report.  The main.py file has many variables set to zero and named using the reference letters in the below package specification.  You can edit these variable expressions as you build your modules/functions and use the example output to verify your calculations are correct. 
1. Write a Python package with modules and functions using keyword arguments.  Use the following directory outline and module names (your first starting point should be a directory called `gradebook` within your `exam01-username` directory):
     ```
	gradebook/
		__init__.py
		student.py
		classroom.py
     ```

1. Create a `gradebook` package.
     1. Initialize the `__all__` variable to the `student` and `classroom` modules.
     1. Create a `student` module.
          1. Create a function named `homework_average` which receives the keyword parameters `grades` and `student_id`.  The function should return a 0 if the student_id is not in the grades dictionary, otherwise it should return the average of all the homework assignments for the given student_id. Reference `<x>` in the below example output.
          1. Create a function named `laboratory_average` which receives the keyword parameters `grades` and `student_id`.  The function should return a 0 if the student_id is not in the grades dictionary, otherwise it should return the average of all the laboratory assignments for the given student_id. Reference `<y>` in the below example output.
          1. Create a function named `total_weighted_average` which receives the keyword parameters `grades` and `student_id`.  The function should return a 0 if the student_id is not in the grades dictionary, otherwise it should return the total weighted average of all the assignments for the given student_id, where homework assignments are worth 25% and laboratory assignments are worth 75%. Reference `<z>` in the below example output.
     1. Create a `classroom` module.
          1. Create a function named `homework_average` which receives the keyword parameters `grades` and `assignment_no`.  The function should return a 0 if the assignment_no is out of range, otherwise it should return the classroom average of all student homework assignments for the given assignment_no. Reference `<a1>`, `<a2>`, and `<a3>` in the below example output.
          1. Create a function named `homework_average_average` which receives the keyword parameter `grades`.  The function should return the classroom average of all student homework assignments. Reference `<b>` in the below example output.
          1. Create a function named `laboratory_average` which receives the keyword parameters `grades` and `assignment_no`.  The function should return a 0 if the assignment_no is out of range, otherwise it should return the classroom average of all student laboratory assignments for the given assignment_no. Reference `<c1>` and `<c2>` in the below example output.
          1. Create a function named `laboratory_average_average` which receives the keyword parameter `grades`.  The function should return the classroom average of all student laboratory assignments. Reference `<d>` in the below example output.
          1. Create a function named `total_weighted_average_average` which receives the keyword parameter `grades`.  The function should return the classroom total weighted average of all student assignments. Reference `<e>` in the below example output.
1. Example output using the references above:

    ```

     
     
5. Edit and run the main.py file to test all the modules and functions using the command below and repeat the steps above until you are satisfied your program output meets the above requirements. I will not grade this file - it is for your use to test the package.

    ```
    python3 -m main
    ```

1. Run the unit testing program to ensure that your program runs as expected.

    ```
    ./test.sh
    ```
       
    The unit testing will output the results of a series of tests using specific input and expected output.  Any error will provide information on where the expected output is different from the actual output.  You will need to edit your source code to fix the error and run `./test.sh` repeatedly until it passes all the test.

## Submission
Periodically throughout the exercise, and when you have completed the exercise, **submit the complete repository to Github**.

   <pre>git add .<br>git commit -m "<i>your comment</i>"<br>git push</pre>

In case it asks you  to configure global variables for an email and name, just copy the commands it provides then replace the dummy text with your email and name.

   <pre>git config --global user.email "<i>tuffy@csu.fullerton.edu</i>"<br>git config --global user.name "<i>Tuffy Titan</i>"<br>git commit -m "<i>your comment</i>"<br>git push</pre>

When you completed the final Github push, go back into github.com through the browser interface and ensure all your files have been correctly updated.  Your files should be exactly outline using the directory structure in step 2.
    
## Grading
1. All points add up to a total of 100 points possible as detailed below.  Partial credit will be given where applicable.

| Points | Description |
| --- | --- |
|50|initial git clone of this repository to your Tuffix machine|
